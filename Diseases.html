            <h2>Tooth decay</h2>
            <p>Tooth decay which is sometimes called cavities is where usually foods high in sugar and not brushing your teeth happen and your teeth "decay". Eating food high in sugar can lead to tooth decay, foods high in sugar include soda, jams, candy, sugar(obviously), chocolate, cakes, pies, ice cream and many many more. However, there are also foods that support your dental health such as low sugar dairy products, sugar-free gum, both green and black tea, and water. In general, to keep tooth decay at bay you should brush your teeth and not eat a sizeable amount of high-sugar products in a very short period of time(don't eat a lot of sugar in one day).</p>
