A sufficient amount of food ensures that your body has the calories it needs to both grow and stay alive(note: staying alive is usually very important). Your body also sends signals when you are full to prevent overeating.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Nutrition as we have talked about before can come in different forms such as protein, carbohydrates, fat vitamins, minerals, etc. Dieting, in general, is regulating the food that you eat to improve your physical condition, especially for reducing obesity. Dieting and nutrition are closely related, with what kind of nutrition is in your food impacting your diet and its effects. For example, if you are going on a diet to help with bodybuilding you would in general want more protein as opposed to fat. However, if you want to lose weight you would want more fibre, vitamins, etc.</p>

            <h2>STRESS ADN EATING</h2>
            <p>In general, when you are stressed you may end up eating some sugary or fatty foods. According to a Harvard article, "Once ingested, fat- and sugar-filled foods seem to have a feedback effect that dampens stress-related responses and emotions." these types of foods are known as comfort foods and are commonly eaten when stressed. Since these "comfort foods" generally contain high sugar or fat content, this can lead to weight gain and increase your risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>HEALTH IMPACTS OF FOOD</h2>
            <p>Different types of food can have different effects on your health. Therefore it is important to know what the effects of certain foods have on your health so you can make the best decisions regarding what you eat. In general greasy, fast, junk high sugar, and processed foods are bad for your health. While vegetables, fruits, healthy greens, whole grains, etc are good for your health. Food can also impact your health if you have diseases such as tooth decay, type 2 diabetes, allergies, cardiovascular disease, etc because certain foods that you eat can either improve or impair your health.</p>
